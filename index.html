        <h1>S.H.O.P: Simplified Harbour-Witnessing Online Platform</h1>
    </div>
    <h1>The Goal:</h1>
    <p>To transition the functioning elements of the Harbour Witnessing excel spreadsheet while removing the pitfalls to provide the best user experience possible.</p>
    <h1>Requirements</h1>
    <p>- Needs to be free </p>
    <p>- Provide collaboration that can be seen by all users </p>
    <p>- Allows new ideas or systems to be implemented without starting from scratch </p>
    <p>- Needs to be multi device compatible</p>
    <p>- Provides Instructions within the project on how to use it </p>
    <p>- Needs to be able to implement automation for various tasks </p>
    <h1>Problems</h1>
    <p>- Unsure what the better platform would be to use a program or a website </p>
    <p>- Finding free options limits functionality</p>
    <p>- I have little to no idea as to the preferences of those who will be using the platform</p>
    <h1>Potential Solutions</h1>
    <div class="red-banner">
        <h1>Google AppsScript/Sheets</h1>
    </div>
    <p>- Can be a webApp (slightly worse than a website), or any of googles other apps</p>
    <p>- Limited Use with how you can write code e.g. less functions</p>
    <p>- So long as the user is familar with googles UI should have no difficulty using system</p>
    <div class="orange-banner">
        <h1> Amazon Web Services </h1>
    </div>
    <p>- Option to be a website or a program</p>
    <p>- Virtually no code limits (only the amount) shouldn't be an issue with the scale we're working at </p>
    <p>- Is the most complicated of the 3 but has the most flexiblitiy</p>
    <div class="green-banner">
        <h1>GitHub</h1>
    </div>
    <p>- Only a website (one page) you have to pay for more</p>
    <p>- No code limitations on how it's written & interpreted</p>
    <p>- Can act as a user friendly hub to various websites and applications</p>
    <h1> My Thoughts</h1>
    <p> We could use GitHub to create 1 central hub/homepage which can be easy to access and edit on all devices. We could add links to webApps or google sheets which 
        could act like the original excel spreadsheet except it would be multi device compatible and live so multiple people can edit in the same document that way it avoids
    confusion as to where to find documents. Another possibiltiy would be to use Amazon Web Services in a similar way, I still need to do more reasearch to find what it's potential is 
    and whether it's free. </p>
    <p> I've also kept in mind the comment about automatically emailing the ships, I've suggested these platforms because they are capable of an idea like that and it should be relatively easy
        to setup with time. </p>
